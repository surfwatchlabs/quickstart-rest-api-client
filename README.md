SurfWatch Labs API Quickstarter : REST API Client
==========================

This repository contains sample code snippets to demonstrate the basic API interactions available from the [SurfWatch Labs Queried API](https://www.surfwatchlabs.com/surfwatch-analytics-api).  These snippets should serve as an example only for the basic API functions, and do not provide additional functionality that will be crucial to the success of your application ( e.g. reconnect logic, complying with rate limits, etc. ).  For more details on these and other REST API examples, visit the [SurfWatch Labs API Queried Quickstart](https://www.surfwatchlabs.com/tech-docs/quick-start/queried) page.

Usage
=====

The examples can be run with [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/).  The dependent libraries were chosen for convenience only; depending on your needs any combination of http client and deserialization libraries can be leveraged.
